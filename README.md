# Real_time_attendance
This project implements a real-time face detection attendance system using Dlib, CMake, and YOLOv8. The system captures video data through a webcam, performs face detection and recognition, and records attendance in real-time. It uses an anti-spoofing model to ensure authenticity and prevent fraudulent attendance marking.
